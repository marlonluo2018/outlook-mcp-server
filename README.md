1. **Check installation**: `python -c "import outlook_mcp_server; print('OK')"`
2. **Test connection**: Start your MCP client with the configuration
3. **Try a command**: "Show me recent emails"

## 🤖 AI Assistant System Prompt

Your AI assistant uses a specialized prompt template that defines its role and behavior. This ensures safe and effective email management.

### Using the Prompt Template

The system prompt is defined in [`agent_prompt_template.md`](https://github.com/marlonluo2018/outlook-mcp-server/blob/main/agent_prompt_template.md). To customize it for your needs:

1. **Edit the template file** to personalize the assistant's behavior
2. **Replace placeholders** like `[User Name]` and `[User Email]` with your information
3. **The assistant will follow** the structured workflows and safety guidelines defined in the template

### Key Safety Features
- **Never sends emails** without explicit user confirmation
- **Always asks for clarification** when information is unclear
- **Follows structured workflows** for searching, summarizing, and drafting
- **Maintains user control** over all email actions

## 🎮 How It Works: Your AI Email Assistant in Action

Following the system prompt guidelines, your AI assistant follows a structured workflow to help you manage emails efficiently. Here's how it works from start to finish:

### 🔄 **The Complete Workflow**

#### **Phase 1: Smart Email Search & Discovery**
Your AI assistant helps you find emails using natural language commands:

**What you can ask:**
- "Find emails about budget approval from last quarter"
- "Show me urgent emails I haven't replied to"
- "Search for attachments from specific senders"
- "Find all emails related to the marketing campaign"

**How it works:**
- **Search Tools Available:**
  - `list_recent_emails_tool()` - Load recent emails from last 7 days (max: 30 days)
  - `search_email_by_subject_tool()` - Search email subjects only (default: 7 days, max: 30 days)
  - `search_email_by_sender_name_tool()` - Search by sender name (default: 7 days, max: 30 days)
  - `search_email_by_recipient_name_tool()` - Search by recipient name (default: 7 days, max: 30 days)
  - `search_email_by_body_tool()` - Search email body content (slower, default: 7 days, max: 30 days)
- Results are loaded into the persistent unified cache (5 emails per page for browsing, with backend limit of 1000 entries)

#### **Phase 2: Browse & Preview Emails**
Emails are displayed in a clean, consistent format with exactly 5 emails per page:
```
Subject: [Email Subject]
From: [Sender Name]
To: [Recipient List]
Received: [Date/Time]
Status: [Read/Unread]
Attachments: [Attachment Count]
```

**Viewing Tools:**
- `view_email_cache_tool()` - View 5 emails per page
- `get_email_by_number_tool()` - Get full details of specific email with configurable modes

#### **Phase 3: AI Analysis & Summary**
When you select an email, the AI provides intelligent insights:
- **One-sentence overview** of the email content
- **Status label** (Awaiting Reply, Urgent, For Information, FYI, Completed)
- **Bulleted action items** extracted from the email
- **Deadlines/commitments** automatically identified

#### **Phase 4: AI-Powered Email Composition**
The AI helps you draft perfect responses using a 4-step approach:

**What you can ask:**
- "Draft a professional reply to this meeting invitation"
- "Help me write a follow-up email about the project status"
- "Create a polite response declining this request"
- "Summarize my unread emails from this morning"

**How it works:**
1. **Gather Information** - Confirms purpose, key points, recipients, tone
2. **Draft & Suggest** - Creates full draft + 3 improvement suggestions
3. **Iterate** - Applies changes + provides new suggestions until satisfied
4. **Send** - Requires explicit user confirmation before sending

**Email Composition Tools:**
- `reply_to_email_by_number_tool()` - Reply to an email
- `compose_email_tool()` - Compose new email

#### **Phase 5: AI-Powered Batch Email Operations**
The AI helps you send emails to multiple recipients efficiently:

**What you can ask:**
- "Forward this meeting invitation to all participants in my contact list"
- "Send this project update to my entire team using recipients.csv"
- "Broadcast this announcement to all employees with additional context"

**How it works:**
1. **Template Selection** - Uses an email from your cache as template
2. **Recipient Loading** - Reads email addresses from CSV file with 'email' column (must be lowercase)
3. **Batch Processing** - Automatically splits large lists into batches of 500
4. **Content Customization** - Adds your custom text before original email
5. **Safe Sending** - Sends via BCC to protect recipient privacy

**Batch Email Tools:**
- `batch_forward_email_tool()` - Forward template email to multiple recipients from CSV (requires 'email' column in lowercase)

**🔒 Key Safety Feature**: No emails are sent without your explicit approval!

## 🔧 Available Tools

### Email Search & Loading
- `get_folder_list_tool()` - Lists all Outlook mail folders
- `list_recent_emails_tool(days=7, folder_name=None)` - Load recent emails (default: 7 days, max: 30 days)
- `load_emails_by_folder_tool(folder_path, days=None, max_emails=None)` - Load emails from specific folder with flexible options
  - **Time-based**: `load_emails_by_folder_tool("Inbox", days=7)` - Load emails from last 7 days (max: 30 days)
  - **Number-based**: `load_emails_by_folder_tool("Inbox", max_emails=50)` - Load 50 most recent emails
  - **⚠️ Mutual Exclusion**: Cannot use both `days` and `max_emails` together - choose one approach
  - **Folder paths**: Use full paths like "user@company.com/Inbox/SubFolder"
- `search_email_by_subject_tool(search_term, days=7, folder_name=None, match_all=True)` - Search by subject (default: 7 days, max: 30 days)
- `search_email_by_sender_name_tool(search_term, days=7, folder_name=None, match_all=True)` - Search by sender (default: 7 days, max: 30 days)
- `search_email_by_recipient_name_tool(search_term, days=7, folder_name=None, match_all=True)` - Search by recipient (default: 7 days, max: 30 days)
- `search_email_by_body_tool(search_term, days=7, folder_name=None, match_all=True)` - Search by body (default: 7 days, max: 30 days)

### Folder Management
**⚠️ Important Workflow**: For folder operations, always start with `get_folder_list_tool()` to discover the folder structure first.

- `get_folder_list_tool()` - **REQUIRED FIRST STEP** - Lists all Outlook mail folders to understand structure
- `move_folder_tool(source_folder_path, target_parent_path)` - Move folders between locations (use full paths from folder list)
- `create_folder_tool(folder_name, parent_folder_name=None)` - Create new folders (supports nested paths like "Inbox/SubFolder1/SubFolder2")
- `remove_folder_tool(folder_name)` - **Permanently delete** folders and their contents - cannot be undone (use full path from folder list)
- `move_email_tool(email_number, target_folder_name)` - Move emails between folders (requires full folder path from folder list)

**Folder Operation Workflow:**
1. **Discover Structure**: Use `get_folder_list_tool()` to see available folders
2. **Identify Paths**: Note the full folder paths (e.g., "user@company.com/Inbox/FolderName")
3. **Execute Operation**: Use the appropriate tool with the correct full path

**⚠️ Important Safety Notes:**
- **`remove_folder_tool` permanently deletes folders** - This action cannot be undone and will permanently remove the folder and all its contents
- **`delete_email_by_number_tool` performs soft delete** - Emails are moved to Deleted Items folder and can be recovered
- **Always double-check folder paths** before performing deletion operations

### Email Viewing & Browsing
- `view_email_cache_tool(page=1)` - View 5 emails per page
- `get_email_by_number_tool(email_number, mode="basic|enhanced|lazy")` - **Unified tool** for configurable email retrieval with media support
- `delete_email_by_number_tool(email_number)` - Move email to Deleted Items folder (soft delete)

### ⚠️ Important: Parameter Mutual Exclusion

**`load_emails_by_folder_tool` Parameter Behavior:**
- **Time-based loading**: Use `days` parameter only (e.g., `days=7`)
- **Number-based loading**: Use `max_emails` parameter only (e.g., `max_emails=50`)
- **Cannot combine**: Using both `days` and `max_emails` together will raise an error
- **Default behavior**: If neither parameter is specified, defaults to 7 days

**Why this design?** This prevents confusion and ensures predictable behavior:
- Time-based loading respects the exact date range without expanding it
- Number-based loading gets exactly the requested number of most recent emails
- No ambiguous "combined" behavior that might confuse users

### Email Composition (Requires User Confirmation)
- `reply_to_email_by_number_tool(email_number, reply_text, to_recipients=None, cc_recipients=None)` - Reply to email
- `compose_email_tool(recipient_email, subject, body, cc_email=None)` - Compose new email

### Email Batch Operations (Requires User Confirmation)
- `batch_forward_email_tool(email_number, csv_path, custom_text="")` - Forward email to multiple recipients from CSV file (requires 'email' column in lowercase)

**Batch Email Feature:**
- Uses an email from your cache as a template
- Reads recipient email addresses from a CSV file with 'email' column (must be lowercase)
- Automatically splits large lists into batches of 500 (Outlook BCC limit)
- Adds custom text before the original email content
- Preserves email formatting with consistent break lines
- Sends via BCC to protect recipient privacy

**CSV File Requirements:**
- File must be in CSV format
- Must contain exactly one column named "email" (lowercase)
- Each row should contain one email address
- Example CSV content:
```
email
user1@example.com
user2@example.com
user3@example.com
```

**Search Behavior:**
- All search tools support `match_all=True` (AND logic) or `match_all=False` (OR logic)
- Email body searching is slower than other fields
- Search terms can include colons as regular text

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Folder Level Limitation**: Maximum 3 folder levels supported (e.g., 'Inbox/SubFolder1/SubFolder2'). This affects nested folder creation with mailbox-specific paths.
- **Folder Deletion Delay**: Deleted folders may require multiple list checks to disappear from the folder list due to Outlook's internal caching.
- **Full Path Requirements**: Email and folder operations require full mailbox paths (e.g., "user@company.com/Inbox/FolderName") rather than relative paths.

### Recent Fixes Implemented
- **Folder Moving**: Fixed COM interface error by using `MoveTo` method instead of `Move`
- **Email Moving**: Enhanced to support full folder paths for accurate targeting
- **Error Handling**: Improved error reporting for Outlook operations
