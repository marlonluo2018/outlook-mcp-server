## 🔄 How It Works

### Simple Workflow
1. **Load emails**: "Show me recent emails" → Emails appear in cache
2. **Browse results**: View 5 emails per page with clear formatting
3. **Take action**: Reply, move, delete, or get AI summary
4. **Confirm before sending**: AI always asks before sending emails

### AI Assistant Behavior
- **Understands natural language**: "Find urgent emails from my boss"
- **Shows email summaries**: One-line overview + key action items
- **Drafts with context**: Replies understand the conversation
- **Never sends without permission**: Always confirms before sending

### Batch Forwarding Workflow
**1. Prepare Your CSV File**
```csv
email
john@company.com
jane@company.com
team@company.com
```

**2. Use Natural Language**
```
"Forward this email to everyone in my contacts.csv"
"Send this project update to my team list"
"Distribute this newsletter to subscribers.csv"
```

**3. AI Handles the Rest**
- Automatically splits large lists (max 500 per batch)
- Sends via BCC to protect recipient privacy
- Adds your custom message before original email
- Provides delivery confirmation

### Time Savings
**Manual forwarding**: 100 emails × 30 seconds = 50 minutes
**Batch forwarding**: 30 seconds setup + 2 minutes processing = 2.5 minutes
**You save**: 47.5 minutes per batch!

## 🔧 Common Commands

```
"Show me emails from last 3 days"
"Find emails about project updates" 
"Draft a reply to John about rescheduling"

```
